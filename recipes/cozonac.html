    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The smell of freshly baked bread from the oven reminds us of childhood and
      the moments spent with the family. At Easter or Christmas, cozonac is
      among the indispensable dishes on the table. It doesn't just have to be
      fluffy, it also has a delicious filling.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <p><strong>For the pastry dough:</strong></p>
      <li>1 kg of flour;</li>
      <li>500 ml of milk;</li>
      <li>4 eggs;</li>
      <li>250 g of sugar;</li>
      <li>50 gr of butter;</li>
      <li>50 ml of oil;</li>
      <li>50 g of fresh yeast;</li>
      <li>lemon peel;</li>
      <li>a pinch of salt;</li>

      <p><strong>For the filling:</strong></p>
      <li>3 spoons of cocoa;</li>
      <li>a vial of rum essence;</li>
      <li>250 gr of Rahat cut into cubes;</li>
      <li>250 gr of ground walnut;</li>
      <li>100 g raisins;</li>
      <li>150 grams of sugar;</li>
      <li>4 egg whites.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Step One</strong></li>
      <p>
        Heat the milk and add it over the yolks. The whole composition is mixed
        well, until the sugar is no longer felt. Add the rum, lemon and orange
        zest.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Step Two</strong></li>
      <p>
        In a large bowl, add the 2-3 sifted flour and make a well in the middle,
        where the milk and mayo are added . Knead until everything is
        incorporated. Heat the butter and oil and add a little at a time, until
        it is incorporated into the dough. Then, cover the dough and let it rise
        for about 45 minutes in a warm place.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Step Three</strong></li>
      <p>
        Beat the egg whites with sugar. Add cocoa, chopped walnut and mix the
        whole composition. After the dough has risen, it is divided in two, and
        the first part is again divided into two pieces. Put the cocoa and nut
        mixture on each one, and add the shit on top. Roll and intertwine both
        rolls. Do the same with the remaining dough.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Step four</strong></li>
      <p>
        Afterwards, it is placed in the cozonac tray, lined with baking paper or
        greased with oil and lined with a coat. Leave to rise for another 30
        minutes, then brush with an egg and sprinkle with sugar. Place in the
        oven for about 45 minutes, until nicely browned on top. In the first
        half hour, the oven door is not opened, so as not to leave the
        composition.
