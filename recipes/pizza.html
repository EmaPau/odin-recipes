    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base
      of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often
      various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies,
      mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then
      baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small
      pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as
      a pizzaiolo.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten
      with the use of a knife and fork. In casual settings, however, it is cut
      into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ cup flour for dusting</li>
      <li>2 cups pizza sauce</li>
      <li>20 slices fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>20 leaves fresh basil</li>
      <li>olive oil</li>
      <li>sea salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li><strong>Step One</strong></li>
      <p>
        Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Step Two</strong></li>
      <p>
        Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast
        begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Step Three</strong></li>
      <p>
        Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots
        remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after
        each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly
        floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Step four</strong></li>
      <p>
        Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat
        with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to
        95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1
        hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a
        ball.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Step Five</strong></li>
      <p>
        Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
      </p>
      <li><strong>Step Six</strong></li>
      <p>
        Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in
        diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup
        of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the
        dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce,
        then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive
        oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough
        balls.
      </p>
      <li><strong>Step Seven</strong></li>
      <p>
        Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until
        cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7
        minutes.
