    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These traditional sarmals are not missing from Romanians' Holiday tables.
      Sarmals are made for Christmas, New Year, the celebration of different
      saints and even Easter (in some areas). The most beloved Romanian
      sarmăluțe are the ones with minced pork (or pork-beef mix), wrapped in
      thin sheets of sauerkraut.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>500 g minced pork (fattier)</li>
      <li>1 medium onion chopped</li>
      <li>50 g of rice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of oil</li>
      <li>salt pepper</li>
      <li>dried thyme, a little paprika</li>
      <li>2 medium sauerkraut</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Step One</strong></li>
      <p>
        I chose 2 pickled cabbage from the barrel. It must have thin sheets that
        roll easily. I tasted them and they were ok. Not too sour and not too
        salty.

      <li><strong>Step Two</strong></li>
      <p>
        I prepared my minced pork, smoked meat (kaiser) and raw pork brisket.
      </p>

      <li><strong>Step Three</strong></li>
      <p>
        This is the raw pork brisket I was talking about. I cut it first into
        slices and then into smaller pieces. So did the smoked kaiser next to
        him.

      />
      <li><strong>Step four</strong></li>
      <p>
        I finely chopped an onion and boiled it in a saucepan with a spoonful of
        oil and a pinch of salt. I didn't let it brown, just become glassy. I
        also put the raw (dry) rice on top of it and cooked it for these 2
        minutes on low heat, stirring constantly so that it does not stick. I
        turned off the heat and pulled the kettle aside to cool.
      </p>

      />
      <li><strong>Step Five</strong></li>
      <p>
        I placed the minced meat in a deep bowl and tossed the (chilled) onion
        rice over it. I seasoned well with salt, freshly ground black pepper and
        dried thyme. I also put 2 good teaspoons of sweet paprika which gives
        flavor and color
      </p>

      />
      <li><strong>Step Six</strong></li>
      <p>
        I kneaded everything well with my hands to make sure I had a homogeneous
        composition. Some now also add water or tomato juice, but I don't do
        that. Under no circumstances do NOT add egg because we are not making
        meatballs or sausages that need to be "tied". The filling does not run
        out of the wires!
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        I told you above that cabbage leaves are cut with a knife by removing
        the thickened portions. I put a spoonful of filling on each piece of
        cabbage leaf and rolled the wire. Then, with my finger, I pushed the
        ends of it inwards. And that's it! My sarmals were about 7-8 cm long and
        about 3.5 cm in diameter..
      </p>
      <li><strong>Step Seven</strong></li>
      <p>
        I prepared my thick tomato juice, chopped cabbage and meats (raw pork
        belly and smoked meat).
      </p>

      />
      <li><strong>Step Eight</strong></li>
      <p>
        I cooked part of these traditional sarmals in a pot on the stove and the
        rest in the oven, in a ceramic form with a lid. I show you the last
        ones. On the bottom of the mold I put a chopped onion (raw, unseasoned),
        2 tablespoons of oil, 2 sprigs of thyme and a layer of chopped
        sauerkraut (the spines from the leaves). This was followed by a layer of
        smoked and raw pork brisket and a layer of sarmale. Among them I filled
        the spaces with meat and kaiser. I continued like this with the sarmales
        until 3 cm below the lip of the ceramic pot.

      <li><strong>Step Nine</strong></li>
      <p>
        On top I finished with a layer of chopped cabbage and 2 sprigs of thyme.
        Whoever wants can also put a bay leaf. I poured thick tomato juice and
        cabbage pulp diluted with a little water (juice from sauerkraut). The
        sausages must be covered with liquid.
      </p>

      />
      <li><strong>Step Ten</strong></li>
      <p>
        I put the lid on the dish and put it in the oven at 180 C for 30 minutes
        and then at 150 C for the next 2.5 hours. In total I cooked these
        traditional sarmals for 3 hours with the lid on. I topped up their sauce
        with a cup of warm water every hour (as needed). At the end, there must
        be sauce up to the middle of the bowl.
