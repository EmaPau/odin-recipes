    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very
      wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an <em>Italian</em> dish
      made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù
      (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include
      ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like
      Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil. The dish may be
      topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically
      cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an
      oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square
      portions.
