# odin-recipes

Hi, I am Emanuel Paulet and this is my real first project with The Odin Project.
I am going to build a basic recipe website. The website will consits of main index.html which contains links to some recepies. As an Italo-Romanian guy the recepies I choose are: Lasagna, Pizza, Sarmale and Cozonac (a typical Romanian dessert). By now (21/09/2022), my knowledge consits in a good understanding of HTML structure and code and basic CSS understing (which I will not use in this project yet). I will keep up-to-date this file with any updates I make to the website.
